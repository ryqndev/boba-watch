# Simple Privacy Policy

You can view the entire privacy policy but here I'll detail exactly what we use at 
the moment. In no way is this the actual official privacy policy (so don't treat it as
such) but hopefully it'll make it clear to others what we do.

## Things we use

The login providers - Facebook login, Google login - give us enough info to setup
a default profile. The information that we use here are basic identifying features like 
name, email, and an avatar for the profile picture. We do not use, nor ask for, extra 
identifying features such as your friends list, other contact info (phone numbers, etc.)
or any other data. The only purpose of this data is for us to setup individual profiles. 

## Your data

We aim to give all users complete control over their own information. We do not
maintain data that has been deleted. (deleted drink data, for example, are 
permanently wiped from our database)

We occasionally will use all aggregated user data to provide helpful stats and metrics 
we may deem interesting to our users. All data we collect and use later on is 
anonymized and does not lead back to individual users. 

### Delete your account

If you want to delete your account and also remove all user data, please send an email to 
ryanqyang@gmail.com with the email/login method you used to signup.

### One last informal note from the creator: 
I originally made Boba Watch because I wanted to keep track of my own boba spending. As 
a user of boba watch, you can be sure that I have the interests of our users at heart. 
I've been pretty behind with deadlines - saying updates will happen sooner than they 
actually do - but it's mainly because of extensive testing to make sure your user data 
is safe and you have complete control over what you share. Thank you for your continued 
support of Boba Watch and hope you continue to use your app!!
